# CSSRule.cfc - ColdFusion CSS Rule Parsing

by [Ben Nadel][1] (on [Google+][2])

__*NOTE: This is a really old project that has not been updated in years.*__

The CSSRule.cfc is a ColdFusion component that can parse and model CSS using
ColdFusion. I love CSS; I think it's like the most awesome, straightforward 
way to describe formatting of rendered boxes. As such, I wanted to use it in
more of my projects. However, in order to do this, I needed to come up with 
a way to parse and maintain the CSS model programmatically inside of ColdFusion.

## Features

* Models a large sub-set of CSS properties (not including auditory features)
* Can handle short-hand notation (ex. font, background)
* Can return a single property or the entire map of properties

## Known Bugs And Issues

* Some CSS rules not supported
